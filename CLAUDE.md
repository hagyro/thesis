# Global Development Guidelines

## About
This is the global development folder for all projects. All responses should maintain academic rigor and technical precision while being practical and actionable.

## Key Preferences
- **Academic rigor**: Evidence-based explanations with proper citations
- **Technical depth**: Detailed explanations over simplified summaries
- **International context**: Consider European/Greek regulatory and economic frameworks
- **Practical implementation**: Balance theory with real-world applicability
- **Efficiency**: Comprehensive yet concise responses with clear structure

## Technical Stack Expertise
- **Statistical/Econometric**: R, Stata, SPSS, MATLAB
- **Programming**: Python, SQL, LaTeX
- **Research areas**: Economics, econometrics, computational finance, quantitative methods
- **Analytical**: Both traditional econometric and modern ML approaches

## Common Commands
*Will be populated as projects are developed*

```bash
# Build commands (project-specific)
npm run build
python -m build

# Test commands (project-specific)
npm test
pytest
python -m unittest

# Lint/format commands (project-specific)
npm run lint
ruff check
black .
```

## Project Structure Patterns
- Maintain clear separation between research/analysis and production code
- Include comprehensive documentation for methodological approaches
- Consider both theoretical foundations and practical constraints
- Address policy and regulatory implications where relevant

## Development Notes
- Prioritize code that supports rigorous analysis and reproducible research
- Include proper error handling and validation for financial/economic data
- Consider international standards and cross-country compatibility
- Balance academic standards with practical business requirements

Standard Workflow
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
8. Use ALWAYS uv run for any python script you do

Workflow Reminders
- ALWAYS read CLAUDE.md for standard workflow
